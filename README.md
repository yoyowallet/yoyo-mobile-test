# Yoyo Mobile Test

You have a choice of problems to solve, ideally currency or gifting based. Some of potential ideas include:

- Realtime BitCoin Tracker: http://www.programmableweb.com/api/coindesk
- A [Stellar Node](https://www.stellar.org/developers/)
- Foursquare/Gifter Mashup. (e.g. 4 Coffeeshop visits gives you a stamp to a coffee card).
- Ideas?


We are interested in quality over quantity and would love to see you show off the following:

- Architectural understanding of the platform.
- Elegant asynchronous HTTP/Socket handling.
- Custom view component(s).
- Clear understanding of programming patterns.
- Dependency and build tooling.

Fork this project, put together your app and send a pull-request, we accept that as a submission. (Kudos for  good git discipline.)
